‘Unforgettable’. That is how I wish to start this. It was an another day and another adventure.

It was a fine sunny day where it all begun. Waking up early in the morning to witness the sunrise at one of the hill peak we were about to climb out of 6 hills with just a tea and bread as a breakfast. It was almost time, to reach the 1st cliff and to witness the sunrise. Undeniably could be one of the best moments one can ever have, to witness the rays of the rising sun at the top of the hill with the greeneries surrounding you under the cliff all over and with the aura you will have when you witness this with around 20 of your dearest colleagues.

We were well prepared for the trek with enough food, water and medicines but the thing that came out of bounds which we were never prepared for is the howling winds. Thinking of being a sunny day and not having enough support to withstand the cool, breezy howling winds which could easily be 20-30km/hr could possibly be our worst nightmare. 

As the day progresses and with lots of ups and downs through out the trek, sharing the limited supplies of water and food we had, helping the tired and the people who got sick to reach the summit of the Meesapullimala, what else it could be if it is not a team work! 

Trekking will definitely be one of the thing that will pull out one’s true character. It was a great character showed by the entire team where every individual helped others in every possible way, be it the push you need physically or mentally. How can one not be happy with being associated with such a team. 

Cheers to it!
